",3,"'-The teacher candidate struggled to facilitate a discussion about classroom norms. 
At the high end, the TC supports students in generating at least one classroom expectation, though it might not be supported with logical rationale.
The teacher did not effectively redirect student behaviors.  TC did not acknowledge two of the behaviors. TC acknowledged all of the other behaviors and attempted to redirect misbehavior, but struggled to do so.
TC used a specific bodily cue in one of her redirections.
TC affect was warm but increasingly irritated/flustered.
Disruptions were lengthy and detracted from the overall quality of the discussion. 
The teacher candidate did not support student engagement. Therefore, there were few moments where all students were engaged in on-task behavior. Some students may be engaging in off-task behavior. Others may be compliant, but not actively engaged.
The majority of dialogue/sounds are (a) TC engaging with students about their behavior (b) TC attempts to keep the discussion afloat during unaddressed student misbehavior (c) student misbehavior.

Another factor contributing to his behavior was likely that it was hard for me to set norms from the beginning since Dev was talking from the beginning (though he paid attention later) and therefore it didn't give Ethan a framework for what my expectations were.","I was able to redirect answers and get students to go deeper into the material than their original surface answers.

TC is somewhat successful with redirecting off-task behavior, although there are a few interactor errors which makes this hard to assess. Many redirections do not include specific cues, but the student stops the misbehavior anyway. There are some moments when all students are focused on the discussion. TC remains calm.

Since these aren't real students, I'm capable of attempting different tasks and seeing what works best.  

I loved that we did a simulator at the beginning of the semester and that we got to try again in the end to see our progress. ","'- I loved that students were actively thinking about what they should and shouldn't do and why, I wasn't sure how to reinforce the norms in the moment with students when they were going against them and that wasn't a good way to see that there was no immediate consequence for students enacting that behavior. (i.e Ethan using his phone after we set an expectation to stay focused and not use our phones) 
2. I did a good job of telling Ethan no in a warm, yet demanding manner. I was stern in the last simulation and when I did that in the actual classroom, it actually disconnected my students and their trust for me. With that being said, in the simulation, I attempted to be authoritative yet kind at the same time. ","I liked the zoom simulations! They were helpful, especially in terms of reflection and being able to watch myself quickly after. ","'- Ethan was off-task and not focused.
- Ethan was being a distraction, particularly to me. (the other students didn't exactly respond to his behavior, but if it continued it could have been more disruptive and contradictive to the norms) 
- He wasn't as fidgety as normal but he was more vocal during this simulation.","'- It may just be hard for Ethan to focus during class and I would want to figure out why. I would want to know if this is a recurring behavior in other classes or if he experiences these behaviors at home/outside of school. If so, I would want to know if these behaviors affected his academic performance. If not, I would want to know if other professionals were giving him expectations to stop his behaviors or items to mediate them. (i.e fidgets for constant movement) ","'- I made sure to relate student ideas back to the text and to make sure that they knew their ideas were relevant. 
- I allowed students to refer to and read the text aloud to use the text as evidence for their ideas and predictions. It was good to discuss the emotions that the story characters were  feeling so that the students could relate more and understand the tone of the story as well. ",I wish we had more time in the simulator to rehearse and try it again! (More than 10 minutes),"1. Visualized reminders: I think having a reminder in the classroom of  how to and when to interact with each other is important for students.
2. A routine: If students have a set structure and routine, they will be less likely to have unproductive encounters with other students because they have designated time for socialization. 
3. Solicited peer interactions: When completing group assignments, it's important to have students be able to talk with each other in a comfortable and designated space. Think-Pair-Share is important for fostering an engaging classroom community.

Another reason that I scored myself a little bit lower was because I really didn't do anything other than tell them to stop talking or be quiet. Instead, I could have used other techniques to get them to quiet down and pay attention more.","I feel a lot more comfortable in there now, so I don't have too many concerns; however, I need to learn more about how to deal with certain situations better so that I can be more prepared.",Ethan was very distracted throughout the whole interaction.,I think that part of his behavior is based on the fact that he is a middle schooler and another part of it is because it is the first day of school. I would want to know how he behaves outside of the classroom and see if it is similar to his behavior inside of the classroom. I would also like to know more about his educational background and see how those behaviors match to these,"I think that I added some extra questions that made it so that students were better able to comprehend what certain aspects of the text were (ex. ""When you think of the word 'suspense', what do you think of?"")

One reason I gave myself a 6 was because I felt like they already understood a lot of the information. I also think that I didn't have all of the answers to their questions, but they did a good job figuring out things on their own. Two of them had great responses to who they thought Lisa really was, which made it a lot easier to talk about the text.","I think that I could have prepared a little bit more for the last scenario, but other than that I think it was fine","I think that some varied learning techniques would help.

-The teacher candidate did not support student engagement. Therefore, there were few moments where all students were engaged in on-task behavior. 
-TC affect begins calm but TC appears increasingly irritated throughout the simulation

He wanted to be able to share his stories and did not recognize that the classroom was not the appropriate place for his actions.","He seemed bored.
He wanted to be somewhere else.

He was not interested in wholly participating in the activity.  
I wanted to provide him with the opportunity share, but without him really engaging or even stopping long enough to talk with me, I had a difficult time from the management side.  I would like to have the opportunity to talk with him one on one in a calm environment.  Hopefully having a conversation that helps expose him to the needs of others, and how his actions impacted them, then we could bolster a working partnership that helps the entire class.

",,"This was unrealistic in that no matter what I did, I couldn't convince Ethan to calm down.  I couldn't pull him to the side, I couldn't move next to him and whisper this is inappropriate, I couldn't use hand signals to encourage him to stop.  Even an unruly kid can be encouraged to behave if they know that you are not going to overly punish them for acting out.  ","Personal relationships.  By not being able to have a personal relationship that allows for me to support Ethan and his actions, I have a hard time improving the classroom climate.  
Legitimate classroom expectations.  As we are able to have a positive relationship, then we can put into place a set of expectations that are reasonable and supported by all of the students.  And without first having a relationship, then I can not help the student to improve in the class.
