-The teacher attempted, with mixed success, to redirect off task student behavior. TC successfully redirected two misbehaviors but most redirections were lengthy and detracted from the overall quality of the conversation
-Affect was really positive
-The majority of dialogue/sounds are (a) TC engaging with students about their behavior (b) TC attempts to keep the discussion afloat during unaddressed student misbehavior (c) student misbehavior.
-The teacher candidate did not support student engagement. Therefore, there were few moments where all students were engaged in on-task behavior. Some students may be engaging in off-task behavior. Others may be compliant, but not actively engaged..
