The coach then tells you exactly what to do, and the next go around, Ethan magically responds.  It seems the goal is not to manage but to find the management technique you need to ""beat"" the simulator.   If this is the management technique you want us to learn, why not just tell us that?  Why not just have the coach come to our class as a whole and give this instruction and modeling?  It also odd, that given the extreme and constant emphasis in Curry on classroom culture, norms, and preventative action, that we would suddenly be asked to do management devoid of all of this and instead manage after-the-fact.
