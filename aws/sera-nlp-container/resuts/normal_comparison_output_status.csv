transcript,21,2019_5_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,1,person1,"Yeah that can be tough. I totally agree. Usually the avatar thats talking will move alittle bit more so keep an eye out for that but I totally understand that. But so you feel pretty good otherwise.  Yeah. Awesome. Why, I think you did a really good job. One thing that I want to commend you on is that you are definitely noticing the when they were occurring and so thats really good because a lot of teachers wont recognize. Wont even recognized it. And so its good to look at students, you know, when they are engaging in behaviors that we dont necessarily want to see because it kind of signals to your students that like, hey, you know, I see you like maybe we should be changing your in some way and so going ahead, like when you go into the , I would love to see you be a little more timely in your . And so, you know, one example, you probably heard me taking notes over here, um let see when Ethan was humming and you couldnt really tell to who, you know, who was talking but he, for the good, good, , kind of continued humming through. I know you noticed it happening but you know, you went on and said, all right class, so what are we going to do today? We are going to set some norms and expectations for the classroom and would anyone like to begin a about what we expect for norms in the classroom to be. And go ahead and raise your hand to see if you like to contribute, Ethan, do you have something that you would like to add. And so this is kind of, your way of like, being like I know you are humming, like I see you doing that but we want to make sure that when we want to see certain behavior from the that we are, first of all, direct and kind of quick about it  That way they dont kind of continue going on. So, you realize that its like coming for a while there. So, I want you to be a little more timely in your redirection. So, if Ethan was to start humming, how could you have been more timely with redirecting him. Youre right. So, but with that I actually, you made a great point where you say, you know, stop humming. So, it sounds like youre kind of worried about finessing the way that you are redirecting students. And so, is there a way you can say stop humming in a nicer kind of more congenial way to the student? But if you do that kind of you say, oh, Im doing well, just continue humming, Right? So, whats this specific behavior that you want to see or not see anymore? Right. So, how can you redirect him? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, a lot of people are little worried about, like, hurting students feelings. How could you say, how could you redirect him with what you just said, in a kind way? Perfect. Please stop humming so we can talk about norms and expectations, thats perfect. And again with that timely piece of making sure that youre not letting him hum for thiry seconds. and you did do this by the way with when the cellphone came up. Right of the bat you said, what is that you said, Okay, Ethan, how about you put your phone away so we can talk about the norms and expectations. And that was perfect and you did that Awesome, okay. So, lets practice be in timely and . Im going to pretend to be a student. My name is  by the way. Okay, ready? alright. Oh, sure, okay. And see, so I know that exact behavior that you want me to stop, okay? And you do that in a very kind way to be as perfect.  Okay. So, how do you feel? You ready? I think you got this. I think you definitely got this.

transcript,18,2019_34_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,1,person7,"So, how are you feeling about that first ? Thats totally up to you. That piece of it.  Okay. So, one thing that made me so excited that I saw you doing consistently is engaging when- like you are noticing when a student is off task or distracting others. And I saw you like trying to engage and Im getting the sense that youre like trying to be kind and to make sure this is the first day. So, I would basically say like you be as direct as you want to be because what I noticed, to make to your simulation stronger, this next time, is that being really specific with a student about what you want them to do or not to do. So, for example, just like kind of, like lets not be distracting so thats a great because youre engaging with it, with them but that can like Exactly. Yeah, and think about like what do I want his eyes to be doing, what do I want his mouth to be doing you know like depending on the misbehavior. So, if you want him to like stop beat boxing, you know, it could be like, Ethan   So just being super specific so that theres no room for ambiguity. Im not being distracting. Yeah, exactly yeah. And then, I dont know if you noticed this but when you said lets put the phone away, he responded right away. Can you are you timing this? Can you tell me when we have like 30 seconds on the clock. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so Im going to be an off task student and I want you to practice like just being specific and you can either tell me what you want me to do or what you want me to not do, but just make sure theres no room for ambiguity. Does that make sense?  Awesome, okay. How did that feel? Really? Yeah, it can be hard to think of like the right thing to say. And also like, yeah I think like you can even cut it down to like, were not singing right now or whatever, if its like hard to be-- but lets do another one. Okay, how does that feel? I like the nonverbal. like I think that thats like the easiest and fastest way to communicate what you want someone to do  Okay, awesome. Im excited to see you try this. Yeah, have fun.","[0.6361390756591526, -0.04385806229881961, -0.21821415310694148, 0.13590827206080208, 0.2124406822356606, -0.19881146970753816, 0.26939356678323884, 0.023161436196878608, 0.059212829459266016, 0.09034900649503236, -0.06815052253672531, -0.1101811004573376, -0.0142511346560479, -0.1834525321712709, 0.10581442428306671, 0.17827102323932317, -0.038834545736270314, -0.13921566502099264, -0.15399759626581272, 0.3592892653299565, 0.10462342798577598, 0.06216215320168942, 0.16162861006858792, 0.10804174754094929, -0.13874788687579598, 0.08154339533447615, 0.018972179335320707, -0.08520263102121331, 0.06663422747851472]",0.30086445752609503

So, I think like there are-- I definitely understand what you're saying like that there are like issues with it but like there are still like some really good like skills that we can practice and that like this is really a good way for us to see them in action and like, ""Wow, I can see like, you know, these five minutes might be different. Like you're still gonna have students who act like this and like who are gonna be, you know, doing something that you don't want them to be doing."" So, if-I was like trying to figure out like how we can best support you like so, with those skills. Yeah, the proximity thing is like so infuriating. You can't like go- and stand and like-- that one I totally understand. But even like when you go, you stand next to them and they still continue, like what do you say to them to get them stop. Cause sometimes it is just like them they get it but like sometimes it's not. So we're like, you know, how do we get that, like this? We're all on board with that. so- Right. So, you have to get the behavior to stop. Like that's like-- So, what we have to think about like, perform to-- you know, like hunt every directions. We have to get this misbehavior to stop. So, a lot of times what it is with students is like is-is specifically meaningless like behavior that you wanna have stop. So, like not letting Ethan keep going with drumming or humming or cursing at someone and like getting that behavior to stop and then you can teach him. So, if you're-- for example, if Ethan is drumming on the desk or something. So, I'm gonna be like, ""Ethan, we're not drumming right now, but do you have something that you wanna add?"" Yeah. Yes, but generally like do they-- and-and he didn't engage with me at all. Yes. I mean, would you in a repressed environment just tell the students like just stop? Would that be your first instinct?  Yeah. And then what do I do if he says no? That's okay. The last time I was in a simulation. Yeah. Yeah. But I can't do that right now. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like my current-- my-- The way I've been trained was always to ignore the negative behavior and redirect it positively. So, like I wouldn't say, ""Please stop that."" I would- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

transcript,2,6-2C,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,,"So how do you feel about that? Really hard. What was so hard about it? Okay. Okay. Well, I totally understand that. Um, well, let's talk about some other stuff- that you could use instead of- sending him away. Um, but we-we'll use this time now, so when you go- back in you'll feel- a little better about it. Um, one thing that I noticed that you did really really well, um, is you were super timely with your redirections whenever a- began,- you would make eye contact or you would say, um, like   drumming away or- typing away back here. Um, you would say-- So let's say, when Ethan started his Darth Vader impression, uh, you said, ""Okay, Ethan, that's not what we're talking about right now. That's not appropriate. Um, does anyone else have an idea?"" And you kind of try to, you know, steer him away from that which is really- because that's not-- You're kind of nipping it in the bud, right? So having that timely redirection, um,- is- you're trying to prevent that behavior from persisting and- um, kind of distracting from others during class. So you did a really awesome job by being timely. Um, so the one thing that I think I want you to work on when you go back in- is being a little more specific in your redirections. Um, so let's see, so for instance, um-- Let's see. So even if we go back to that Darth Vader,- that one we were just talking about, um, you said, ""That's not what we're talking about right now. That's not appropriate."" Um, but the next time he- like if he starts doing an impression again, I want you to just say, ""Ethan, please, stop your mumble voice."" So do you see how that's specific? Yeah. So why would that be better than, um, maybe saying, ""That's not appropriate""? Yeah. Exactly, you're giving me the exact behavior that you want to see. Um, ""Please talk in your regular voice"", right? Again, like you said, stating it in a positive term. Um, but being specific. So when you say appropriate, what's-what's- maybe not so great about the word appropriate? Yeah. Absolutely, like it's totally subjective. It's like the word respect. Well, what respect is to you might be different from me, right? Awesome. Um, so let's see if I can find another example on here, um, let's see. So when Ethan started to making video game noises, kind of in the beginning. Um, you said-- So you were talking about what your goal was gonna be for today and you said, ""So what are some things, uh, what are some of the things that you think are important to build up a positive classroom community?"" Um, and you said, ""Ethan, we need your eyes and ears up here."" And he kind of continued. So again, you were really timely, right? You kind of caught that, the behavior was happening. He was making this silly noises, but what could you have done instead? mhmm. But so he's making noises and you said, ""We need your eyes and your ears up here."" Right, exactly. ""Please be quiet."" Exactly, because my eyes and my ears can be on you, but- I can still be making silly- noises. Okay, awesome. Um, so what we're gonna do now is a little role play. Um, I want you to use the strategy that we just talked about, so being specific. Um, I'm gonna pretend to be an off-task student and I want you to be as timely as you were before and specific like we just discussed. Okay, are you ready?  Right, voice off. I know exactly what you're trying now. Okay, perfect. Um, I also like the tone of your voice, right. You weren't-- Um, you were very calm, you- weren't intimidating, you weren't, uh, abrasive in any- in any way. So that was perfect. Um, so I'm gonna do, um, do another behavior. Let's see if you can do it again. Um, so it's at the beach this weekend and it was like totally awesome and I just wish I was there- right now instead in the classroom. Um- Great. So that was perfect when you said, ""Voice off, eyes up here."" Be careful though, if you had stopped with, um, ""We're not talking about that right now."" Yeah because what's that. Right, should I just not talk about the beach- or does that mean I can talk about, um, playing video games later, right? So again,- that specific, but again, you did a really nice job with that follow up of, you know, ""Please be quiet right now."" That was perfect. And again, you're voice was great, your body- your body language is friendly and open to the kids so you won't be intimidating them- in anyway or-or kind of giving them a push back. So, good, alright. Well, I'm so excited to see you be specific when you go back in. Um, keep it up and do you have any questions? alright, cool.

transcript,9,2019_58_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person3,"alright. Nice job. Like so many questions for us to answer, before I even talk to you. How do you feel about the first ? Yeah, yeah, and of course proximity and those things are still great and important to use in the classroom but right, it's not possible to sort of model that right there. So, what I want to talk about today is I saw an interesting progression where you got better and better but for the next one, I want to see you to do the things that I thought were great but consistently. So, the two things that I saw you do that I want you to continue doing are to address the behavior like right away as soon as you notice it. The first one he was humming for a little while Before you did, and all the other ones you like said something right away, so keep doing that. Yeah. So, there's two parts: one is yeah, it could be bothering other students. The second part Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just sort of general like it's not really an appropriate thing for a student to be humming over a teacher kind of thing even if it doesnt bother you . And then the third piece is that if students are able to do small things, then they could and nothing happens and that's often when they choose to escalate and then it will get to a point where it's easier to fix it earlier rather than later on. That's a great question. So, early and right away and then the second piece is making sure that what you say to the student when you are addressing the behavior is as clear as possible. So, , I think there was one time where you said, Ethan, like stop singing, something like that. And that was great. And he stopped right away. But there was another time at the end where you said Ethan, tell your voice to stop, please. And Ethan was like voice stop, right?  So, you want to make sure that what you say is as clear so, that kind of thing doesn't happen to students. I promise you from my experience, because they will like take any of those opportunities to do that with you. So, what can you could you have said to Ethan instead of He was singing. Yeah, exactly. As simple, as short as possible. As an alternative, if you find yourself saying stop, stop, stop, all the time. You can give the reverse, which is to tell them what you want to see. So, what do you want to see from Ethan in this situation? Yeah, one positive behavior, yeah. And I would you to use silent rather than quiet, because well, Im talking quietly right now, there's a risk that you run when you say quietly. That was like a big thing when Im started teaching. Yeah, so, and then the want part that was like my phrasing, but you can just say, Ethan, I need you to sit silently. Yes. Sound good? Okay, I'm going to be Ethan, for a little while. I'm going to do some different behaviors. They might be similar, they might be different and I just want you to respond as quickly as possible and as clearly as possible. And remember, you can tell me what to do or what not to do. And it's the same sort of situation where what I shouldn't do. Okay, so . Excellent. And you can add like, please or a smile, something that sort of indicates you're not upset with them, right? You're just like, very matter of fact, this thing just So, there is a face, but not a voice you never want it to be mean voice. I dont know if this is the space that I can, like, get into the face thing. Yeah, I dont have a good answer. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. And some of that is just the practice I'm picking up the kids that it works for and the kids that it doesnt work for. Some kids will need a smile and some kids will need something more severe. But, for this case, don't worry so much about the facial other than the smile. You dont need the severe part, especially because its the first day of class.

transcript,14,2019_101_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person5,"Hello. Okay, so how do you think at first run in the simulator went? Its challenging. So just so you know, it's totally okay to do that. Don't feel like you can't because, again, you're kind of being put into this with the context that its first day of class. And you would do that on the first day of class. But as you mentioned, with the classroom issues that arise its hard to get through what you need to get through when you do obviously focus on those other things but it's totally okay. And they're throwing a lot at you, I totally get it. So, but in the little bit of time we have, we can just talk about some things that will make you feel a little bit more prepared the next time you go in. So, first of all, I do want to mention that I was really excited to see that you were keying into the behavior the misbehavioras soon as it started, whether you're kind of like smiling or youre like just for looking at them right away. And that's really good because it lets us know that you already have the lens to kind of recognize that misbehavior as soon as it begins, so keep doing that. Another thing that you're constantly doing is when that misbehavior , you did make several attempts to in some way, redirect the . So, that's great as well. Um, what I think would be most for our brief conversation today would be focusing in on ways to make those directions as specific as possible to the behavior that you want to see stop. Okay. So, for instance, how about we do this, I'm going to kind of givego back to an example in your last , and then we can kind of talk about what happened and maybe how we can like revamp it to make it look a little better. So, at one point, about two minutes in, Ethan starts whispering, right? And you were talking about one of the norms is listening when someone is talking, so you were really trying to get at that that wasn't the thing to do by talking about what you would like to see happen. And you said, Ethan, the norm when I'm talking or when someone else is talking is to listen, and you talked about what it means to be a good listener. It means looking at me and that's my . Notice that he didn't really respond to that, right? And I will, I will comment that everything that you were saying was very positive, but just notice it wasn't having the impact that you wanted it to. So, one thing in terms of making it as specific as possible, so he was whispering, so be like, Ethan, please be quiet and stop. I know that kind of seems like a command, and youre on the first day. But you also have to realize that if you don't kind of saypoint out the exact behavior like you want to see stop, there may be different like miscommunications on, like, what he is and what you're expecting, okay? So, why might that be better? Like, Ethan, please stop talking or please stop whispering? Why might that be better than kind of the interactions that happened between you and Ethan in that scenario? I agree. Well so the other side of that, the flip side is just keep in mind that if you don't point out the direct behavior and you continue to have those long exchanges of, you know, back and forth, like the amount of class time youre thinking about and how that's the other students in the class. So, but I know where you're coming from, it's kind of hard because you're trying to establish rapport in this scenario in the first day. So, another thing I want to say, feel free again to insert please in there, so Ethan please stop talking. Try not to phrase it as a questioncan you please stop talking? Because that's not direct, right? And just trying to apply that to as many scenarios as possible.","[0.5741149744532488, -0.17514627745491707, -0.030011556745877535, -0.2791476794367434, 0.22304932476188488, 0.3168213272795365, -0.20431196497250034, 0.13788406714016707, -0.11454946915928288, 0.019413566019789205, -0.09098638925807985, 0.05065547691814391, -0.03756336617602564, 0.04087549048673468, 0.00694415624990739, 0.41739933552333314, -0.028382421815975046, -0.17957294487853911, -0.10926590981393758, -0.11053687381779832, 0.1879515146562239, -0.09789597919893281, -0.20738420119502468, -0.00270897303016278, -0.03628429861287982, -0.033640451948720666, -0.009677452802990524, 0.007499350778796511, -0.024120389133993798]",0.19625426243213315
transcript,12,2019_42_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person3,"Aside from terrible, before I tell you my feedback tell me what you think either like, if you do think it was it was so . What do you think made it that way, what would you do get or maybe find something what you did well? Yeah, for sure. And don't worry about those things because that's what most people look like when they come in the simulator. So, what I do want to say is that, I think you did a really great job of making sure that you've responded to all the behaviors. You did say and you didn't just ignore it, and that's like the first step is, you have to notice what's going on and say something about it. So, you're on the right track. The thing that I want to focus on for our coaching session before you go back into the simulator is around what you say and how you say it when you talk to Ethan. So, you were right, you notice that you had you said a lot of different things trying to get attention. Hey, Ethan Im waiting, hey, Ethan and then quite a few times you asked would you mind and then, you would change it would you please. So, what the goal is, is to kind of say what you need to say but as short as clearly as . So, there's no long conversation back and forth where you say things like, well I am very respectful or I wouldn't mind, all that takes time away from class. Does that makes sense? So, can you try thinking of a plan like doing ethan is doinf what can you say to me just really short and simple to get me to that? Yeah, perfect. Yeah. So, you can as you could say what you want to see from me, you can also tell me what you want me to stop doing. So, in this case you would say Ethan Perfect. And that's all you need to say. You don't need any of the would. Would you please or would you mind that because you don't want to give that extra opportunity for students to argue with you. And you don't need to say, hey, Ethan, and wait for his . Most times students are very interested in what the teacher is . So, they might purposely not respond to you but they're usually paying attention. It would be only the case if, if you would say, just Ethan please stop drumming and it looks like they really aren't paying , then you can repeat it or So, at that point, you maybe want to make sure they heard you, right? So, that's the point so that it can be done and you can do here in your classroom, you want to be like in proximity closer to them, that kind of thing. But start from the assumption that they are paying . Because most kids are aware that what they're doing is not right necessarily. And so, they're there they are waiting to see what the teacher's going to do especially on the first day of class. They could be testing the boundaries something. Okay, so we're going to do some practice in a second. But before we do, just remind me why is it better to have like shorter, clear answer then . Excellent. alright. I'm going to continue to the Ethan first and I want you to respond to Never going wait to actually I dont know the words to this song What was the problem here? Yeah. Thats right. Excellent. You can say please, thats okay. But you don't want it to be a question that because then my answer can just be no which is what you want to avoid. So, please is fine, smiling is good. Like, you don't need to be like angry and you even don't want to be angry or negative about it. You want to have like the positive effect. You just don't want to get emotion. alright. Perfect. Yep. All right. You feel good?  Questions for me? Like when they should be listening to you. You can go like this or you can say stop talking or just stop talking honestly should do. Okay. alright. You got this, simple and quick.","[0.5782576176773634, -0.1845167081384388, -0.10859899128231659, -0.21442693246282044, -0.21823347376203764, -0.1179059792149816, -0.23424209423053258, -0.09156516855725183, -0.0636216624353065, 0.2578550233070728, -0.35661950346446075, -0.18680094373406236, -0.2413972442961487, 0.06504734618654434, 0.12206505047813267, -0.037814372111647204, 0.0004845268976024118, -0.11159244567242023, -0.07654380688494433, 0.07603669551014888, -0.26762247387499505, 0.09283621856031818, 0.019398689049998256, -0.1276314040873664, 0.07112405218530192, -0.0958319328205983, -0.01852014540595456, 0.044279845735856097, -0.005394700288946148]",0.24323688064211488
transcript,13,2019_38_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person7,"How are you feeling about the first simulation? Okay. So, thats totally fine. Im going to get you ready for the second one. Okay. So, one thing that makes me super excited that I felt like you were doing super consistently is noticing the behavior right the way like as soon as Ethan or Dev started doing anything you tried to engage right away which I think is great. So, like you are noticing and you are reacting which is one thing that we really want is to be timely and to think carefully about like, okay we are going to engage our students when they are off-task. The next round that you do I want you to focus on like telling the students specifically what you want them to do or not to do. So, just being like super direct. Okay, So, for example, in the last one when Ethan was lets just say opera singing, you are like hold on one second. And, what I think would be helpful to stop the behavior is being more specific about what you want him to do. So like what do you want his hands, his mouth, you know, like so that theres no room for ambiguity so that the kids arent like oh, well I am holding on Im just like singing while I hold on. Okay. So, the next time he starts opera singing or anything, pretend hes opera singing, I want you to be like Ethan voice off. So, like specifically telling him like really directly and you even use even use like a non-verbal. They will respond to a non-verbal if you use one. So, what about that, is like better than being like hold on one second if youre like Ethan voice off. Yeah, thats perfect because its like what are you doing with like your eyes, yours hands, your mouth. So theres no ambiguity. Okay. alright. So, Im going to be an off-task student. And, and Im going to give you an opportunity to practice  just so I know you feel really good about it before you go back in. Okay. So, pretend that Im Ethan and Im doing my Perfect. Okay. So, I really like that. I would even get to the like really specific stuff like right way. Yeah. So, like because you are taking time to like appreciate him and, you know, its like taking time away from the other kidsdos like engaging you, you know, like how Jasmine was like I cant even hear myself thinking. So, I would like get to it as fast as you can. And being direct is, you know, like hes not going be like mad that you are telling him to put his hands together because thats like a neautral thing So, lets try one more time. Okay. Perfect. I love that. And now you can immediately pivot into talking with the other students. Because you have like great ideas. Like I love that you went around and solicited information from them and then you are going to try to connect that to building the norms so like getting to addressing behavior faster will let you like spend more time doing that. Because I think that was great. You should feel really good about the way that you- you are obviously prepared, totally ready, this is a lot. So, dont worry. But, yeah just, I would just immediately just shut it down. alright. Yeah. Do you have, we still have a minute so do you have questions or thoughts or do you want to practice anything else? Okay. Yeah. And, this is like, this is why we practice because its like, you know, you know exactly what to do. Its just like hard when you are like juggling like Im trying to, you know, create this space and, you know, interact with multiple students and I have this other thing happening over here. So, yeah, yeah awesome. Okay, youre going to do great. Yeah, of course. Were ready, yeah. Okay. alright. Yup anytime.

transcript,8,2019_106_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person3,"So tell me how you feel about your first simulation.  Uh-huh. alright. I understand. I think you did a really great job of being like, positive and calm the whole time, which is super, I mean, a huge base part of like keeping students engaged. If you react or negatively to misbehavior, that is like, oh, so wrong. So, thats a really great thing you should keep doing as you do the next and in your behavior redirections in general. And then, I want to spend the rest of the time talking about, Ethan, and sort of, how do you respond to that kind of thing. So, the biggest thing that I noticed in your responses is that you often like, were talking to Ethan when he was misbehaving. But you almost never said what you wanted Ethan to do or not do. So, you didnt actually give him the feedback about his behavior. Does that align with how you were seeing what happened? Yeah, you should direct. Well, you also didnt say you didnt explicitly asked him to stop it either. You said an expectation is that everyone is unless Ive called on them. And you saw head nodding so you asked, like, do you agree with me. And you tried to ask him to participate in the conversation like, asking him what do you think. But you didnt say to him like, Ethan I need you to stop humming or Ethan please be quiet directly. Does that make sense? Definitely, yeah. And so, I think this is not like a and I dont think you did a bad job. I think you were very about what youre trying to say. I think thats great. So, lets talk about in the remaining time like, how can you do those things in a positive way because you definitely dont want to embarrass kids but it is really important to be really clear with your with like, this is what I want and this is what I dont. Otherwise, kids get confused and if they do receive a consequence later on or other can start doing as they see he can do it. It can create chaos really quickly. So yes, dont embarrass them, yes be positive but we still we dont want to avoid giving them- sorry Im just looking at the time to see how much time I have left here. We dont want to avoid giving them that direction, and sometimes thats the most helpful thing in terms of managing behavior. So, how do how can I do that. Yeah. So let me, two tricks Im going to give you that I think have helped me with that. One is to like, you can stay away from the kind of dont do this and focus on what you want to introduce. So, the phone for example as Im going to put it on the table, I would you can say also like, just to put it away which is what he did at the end. So that kind of like, what is the thing that you want to happen thats always more positive than saying I dont want you to do this thing. You can also use nonverbal signals like if students making noise, oftentimes, just like that.. Its Yeah. Its very, very sophisticated technology. And that is both sort of like, less disruptive for you when youre talking. But its also more discreet, because you dont have to like, call out the students . Yeah. I mean, that was like, hey, Ethan one second, and then lets and then go back to Eva. And you want to make sure that you sort of like, continue what you were doing as quickly as possible. That also sort of makes it sends a signal to students like, this isnt a big Im calling everyones attention to. Its like, hey, Ethan.  So, thats where you can give the positive like, hey, Ethan and I would still do it still helps reinforce to other kids what the is. And, hey Ethan, were not talking right now. Hey, Ethan, please be were silently listening right now. And, you can also frame it in that like, we are sometimes its like  Yeah, he was just like, Im just giving you a reminder. And that kind of tone then. Hey, Im just giving you a reminder of what were doing right now. And its kind of like, Im just helping you out. Does that help? Oh Im sorry. Its been past the five minutes. So I didnt manage my conversation well. So, alright then. So head back over. So now, you have ..","[0.5623479361279925, -0.18734489200306162, -0.3453134838615559, 0.015227700674883082, -0.2535147951946492, -0.06289734451546045, -0.016473313032509485, 0.09268857868579647, 0.08856003636989665, -0.008535246001008329, 0.41841150331469384, 0.07444274278837064, -0.12738638965777904, -0.14234744961675228, -0.18819738663106056, -0.05710437090284994, -0.10554420692111198, -0.23924384548542932, -0.08937435729795545, -0.009335766527242233, -0.18497178957313135, -0.21863301302129018, -0.04028464758136821, -0.01044294427274775, -0.06418032827177166, -0.05753899758207319, -0.1369541438551454, -0.043526314084974725, -0.011415752656943584]",0.22010944677770597
transcript,19,2019_66_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person4," alright, so how do you think that went? What do you mean never great? Well there was one redirection that you used twice that actually worked quite successfully, you remember what it was? Quiet hands quiet mouths? On both times you use that that was successful Yeah. So, that idea that this was all not working- do rest on the fact that you did have several examples where you actually did work well. So, lets try to replicate more of those. So what Id like to have us focus this conversation on is for you to be more specific with naming the student, naming the behavior, then naming the redirection. So like for example, the phrase, quiet hands quiet mouths, does that specifically identify a student thats potentially not following that advice? It does? If I just say the phrase, dont forget our expectation, quiet hands quiet mouths. Not just a little, yeah. I mean, so as soon as you see something, so for example, Ethan was beatboxing. What can you say to Ethan that is specific that redirects his behavior? What do you think? So can you see them? Hell be like, yeah, you can see my hands. So what can you say? Ethan, hands on your lap. Eyes on me. I mean, so youre identifying the behavior that he is exhibiting, specifically to him. And then youre providing him with a redirection. So then what would a non-specific response look like if I was texting? So whats an example of a non-specific response? But from you. Uh-huh. Perfect, great. So now you can flip that and say- what could you say now thats very specific to redirect my behavior or excuse me, to stop the behavior and redirection him. And just eyes on me? Right. But what are you also trying to do at the same time? In general, what are you trying to do? Yeah. Youre trying to teach a lesson. So in terms of trying to invite folks in, Im totally with you. But its a matter of like, if youve got 16 redirections that you have to get through, you need to make sure that each one is succinct. Yeah, so sort of the next step of that would be in addition to being specific, its being succinct.. You know, so the idea of like, if you see a cell phone for example, you could then say whats a specific response? Uh-huh. And then to be short you can be like, Ethan, cell phone in your pocket, eyes up on me. Uh-huh, just real quick. alright? So then what would a non-specific response look like, if I was whispering to Jasmine and if my name is Ethan? Perfect. So how can you make it more specific? Okay. Even faster, what do you think? So just please be quiet, name the behavior. 8] There you go or just voices off. Something- thats just a matter, so again, those best, sort of three step formula of name the student, name the behavior that you want them to stop doing. And then offer them the redirection that youd like them to do. With me so far? Okay. So then lets practice for example, if I am  and if I am doing one of these things. Whats an example of a specific response if Im ? Your phone where Im sorry? In your desk? alright, okay. So again So youve got the formula, so again, the name, youre naming the behavior that you want to see stop. And then youre offering the specific thing that you want them to do, as opposed to that more general expectation piece, Okay? So now lets hear you try it with lets say, Ethan starts doing an impersonation of somebody, what could you say? These are things that I love, I love doing impersonations in the classroom. This is- Okay. Or you just say, Ethan no impersonations right now, voices off, eyes on me. So youre naming the behavior. I mean, as you can get a sense of it in civil environment. alright, so do you feel comfortable? With these specific responses. What are the elements? We have the name. There you go. Im excited to see you try it. . alright, lets go. Im feeling good.","[0.5562146116395136, 0.041886888940056224, 0.22117020187451308, 0.47348659569117246, -0.09286070986553184, 0.08403699808571251, -0.05137462623795125, -0.08288555259347788, 0.14166162018543255, 0.06602481650872688, 0.07184083426726241, -0.0823333086034917, 0.05619143570667551, 0.298612547979595, 0.006544186575728686, 0.04880916947440263, -0.27755399447211204, -0.22283793349378297, 0.20366314213139666, -0.03293549011113272, 0.12669370758214593, 0.0930436435953868, 0.09851697757583007, -0.20012794084752758, -0.10784306123931311, -0.03787139250934337, 0.012330245068382114, 0.04339288539830383, 0.02510152605089369]",0.277442335294088
transcript,20,2019_20_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person1,"alright, so come on over. How do you feel that you did there? Do you feel- yeah, its a bizarre situation, I totally agree. Please dont feel like please dont be embarrassed with us, its just.  Okay, I understand that. The techniques that were going to talk about though should apply in classroom setting too. So, well go into it with an open mind, hows that sound? Okay, cool. So, I feel like you did, you actually really very well. I hope you walk out of that feeling bad. I know we can be all nervous, whats going on. I noticed that you were, you know, the behaviors as they were occurring and you are addressing them. The one thing that I would like see more when we go back in is being a little more specific in your interaction with . So, for instance, so one time that you did a really excellent job with this was, sorry, you probably heard me taking notes. When Ethans phone went off, you eventually got to the point where you said, Ethan, put the phone away please and the phone went away. And so, I want you to, kind of focus of being more specific with those redirections. So, that students know exactly what it is that you want from them in terms of behavior you either dont want to see or that you do want to see. So another example, lets see, so when Ethan was beat-boxing, you said Ethan, can you stop for a second. And he said, Im just beat-boxing. And so, how could you be more specific with him, if you wanted him to stop beat-boxing or start doing something else. Other than just saying, can you stop for a second? What will be a more specific thing that can say in there? Yeah, absolutely. Just naming the behavior, right? So just saying, you know, Ethan can you please stop beat-boxing. So, the way that you phrase it as a question, its perfectly fine. Just kind of naming that specific behavior there. So, let me come with another example here. Okay, so when he started to sing and I feel like your response, you know, youre being very amicable and friendly with him. You said, you know, you try to re-engage him and said, Ethan, how can you come prepared for class. And you said, you know, I prepared this little opera piece and you kind of hooked into that and said, okay, so, that clearly took a lot of work outside of class, you know, outside of school. So one way you can come is by putting a lot of work, you know, outside the school. But then he would he kind of continued singing. So, if you wanted him to stop singing in this scenario, what you could have said to him? Yeah. You could just say, you know, please stop singing and you know, making it, you know, still being kind with him the way that, you know, you had you seemed to be developing rapport with him, which is really great. So, I want you to continue to have that continue to have it developed rather. So, why is it better to be specific with students like in that redirections that youre giving them rather than saying, you know, can you please stop doing that? Making a more general statement.  Right. Yeah , exactly, it kind of removes that within that situation because, you know, please stop doing that can mean anything. And so youre naming a specific behavior that you either do or dont want to see for that matter. So, Im going to -were gonna do a little role play here. Im going to pretend to be a student in your class and I want you to use specific redirection with me for the . My name is , by the way, just in case you forgot. Okay, you ready? alright, so pretend youre in the same scenario  Sure. And its just, right its just kind of a quick, you know, you didnt wait a long time to do it and let me go on. You let me to redirect or you rather redirected me pretty quickly. Do you have any ? Do you feel comfortable going back in, confident ? Okay. Yes, Im excited to see you be specific and timely again, you dont have to let them go on and on, kind of say just like you did there with me, kind of pulling back in pretty quickly. Sounds good? Okay, alright. Well, then well get you back in there.","[0.6059433028211592, -0.1602070625338875, 0.015472681476182075, 0.019068419954643753, 0.39063418229446895, 0.011669205744660656, -0.1196585226687483, 0.21556081794494125, 0.09924584445982584, -0.24455210869932734, 0.07252860515721345, -0.25471944252343826, 0.1260284495212136, 0.048973382903724216, 0.17049971718397047, -0.24767659829571706, -0.1739490256963452, -0.03343770486799011, 0.021179331295488962, 0.11055054389312659, -0.059943467304520125, 0.04163197130811619, -0.172480467463312, 0.12419274086985478, 0.18516447758752105, -0.12342207052540352, -0.022079024255745917, -0.0012394361644244881, -0.0004812007421660003]",0.25144857975928125
transcript,22,2019_119_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,,"alright. So, how are you feeling about Okay. Well, hopefully we can get you out in a little bit of time, hopefully we can you get going even more prepared for the next time So first of all, I just wanted to say that I really that you are able to remain calm and youre very collective and you kept being, just kind of pushing through even though they were throwing at you, and I really respect that. And, the other thing I would like to point out that I was excited about as I was watching you, is that every time when the speaker was every time it began, you were immediately keying into that and thats really important because that let us know that you already have a lens for acknowledging those misbehaviors as soon as theyre starting. I think thats really . So keep doing that moving forward and also you are making to redirect the misbehavior. But I think that thats where we have room to grow within this next simulation in making those redirections as specific as to the behavior that you want to see stop. Okay. So again, were going to focus on the specificity making it as specific to behavior. So, for instance, I want to go to an exact example, just so like we have some room for conversation. So theres a point about two minutes and where Ethan starts whispering And youre like, Ethan, could you focus back on the teacher please, well have lots of time to share about our personal lives later, right now, Id like for you to focus. What I would really like for you to do in that circumstance is to just be like, Ethan please stop . Like, just point out very specific the behavior that you want to see stop. And you dont have to say please but a lot of people feel like it helps them because then youre not like giving a direct command. But yes, Ethan, please stop whispering. So, how is that a little bit better than the exchange an ideas back and forth that happened between you and Ethan in that ? Perfect. I love that. So, there leaves like no room for miscommunication. And also, like youre not taking as much class time way  Yeah. So, you would actually have more time to focus on rules and expectations and also the other students will be able to be more engage. Because they kept giving you, like, I cant hear okay. So lets just do a little practice. Just to remind you, my name is So Im going to engage in a misbehavior and Id like you to bring me back in. Did I tell you have known that ..  Okay. So I like that. Theres a couple of suggestions Im going to give so noticing you said that, you said could you please stop . So be very cautious of not doing that. That came up a couple of times during the simulation when you were pointing out the , but you were phrasing it as questions, then theyd be like, well I could but Im not, right. So just try not to phrase it as a question.  So,  please stop talking. alright. Also, another suggestion if you also, you can also use non-verbals to make it as like as succinct and as brief as possible. So, you could just be like That would work too so yeah. How do you feel about that? Good. And yeah, so like I said Id just try to be as as possible and as succinct possible. So youre taking up, you know, not as much time. So, were good and were close to time, close to time.","[0.5764204590246595, -0.03895625224437529, -0.15691215481131784, -0.03018886714218872, 0.08823328014638583, 0.4060008528566951, 0.06957461477774488, -0.27529560616290744, -0.27988334269928133, 0.01798609601189826, 0.2274684648955698, -0.04422873559923959, 0.20374948402934315, 0.1954689832301914, 0.0874674428683965, -0.02354015813936409, 0.005874333410205546, 0.18015070505780778, -0.26273274276040187, 0.07110559272878413, -0.17940217975268746, 0.04285646697801322, 0.09085466744825785, -0.04120438772614176, -0.10775812792567625, 0.021163463631859933, -0.03415085638206223, 0.05580704223851282, -0.01637515472953523]",0.2520476945940342
transcript,23,2019_22_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person5,"Just go ahead and take a seat. Youre fine. You dont have to worry about this. Thats just for if... Yeah. Thats just if its self-reflection. So Oh, thatsI was getting ready to ask you. How do you feelhow do you think that went? Bad? Okay, yeah. And thats okay! Its set up to make youyeah, kind of grapple with what to do. And thats all right. So, hopefully in the brief time that we have, we can get you feeling even more prepared and better, like, going back in. So, I just want to take a moment to point out some things that I saw that you were doing and that I really appreciated. So, first off, thank you for maintaining enthusiasm and being completely all the way throughout. Even though I know that its probably like the longest five minutes of your life. And then second off, I want to acknowledge the fact that you were continually recognizing the misbehavior as soon as it began. And you were very timely with that. And you were immediately trying toonce you noticed it, you were saying, if you ignored it, what would happen, or if you redirect it, how to redirect. Right? So, I think that to make your next even stronger, I would like to focus on making those comments that youre using to try to redirect the students, making them as specific as possible to the behavior that you want to see discontinued. Right?  So, Im going to go back to an exact example from, you know, from your last simulation. So, the second instance that second thing that happened was Dev started whispering and trying to distract Savannah. Yeah. He was talking about rocket club, right? So, some of the things that you said in that were like, hey, Dev, hey, is this a good thing to be doing right now? And you ask that question again a little later, like, should we be doing this right now because he kind of offered no response. And then, you try to, like, redirect by talking about establishing good routines throughout the class. Right? And trying to bring in setting expectations with clearly the fact that he was engaging in a behavior that you did not want to see him doing. Okay. So, one of the things that I want you to kind of do in those situations, is just to be like, Dev please stop talking. Like, just point out right away. The moment that he starts in the behavior, point out the behavior that he is doing that you would like to discontinue. So, be as specific as possible. And, as succinct as possible. Okay! So, why would that be better than what happened? Right. And I understand! This is a little tricky of a because you are like the first day and whatnot. So, I can totally appreciate that. But you also have to realize with really young , youre probably going to have to give them very specifics of like what behavior. Because I think there was one instance where you ask them to pay attention. I think this was Ethan, hes like I am paying , like, you know, like, because what it means to them maybe totally different than what it means to you. So just try to be as specific as possible. So, how about we kind of go through an example? Im going to pretend to be an off-task student. My name is . And then I want you to try to model slash practice what we just talked about. Are you ready?   Okay. So, good. I really appreciate the way that you kind of got right to it. Couple notes. Be careful about saying can you do this? Right? Because then you leave it open to by asking a question. So, just be like,  stop. And, you can say please, it makes them feel better. Like, please stop drumming on the table. Also, you dont have toyou were going to by giving an explanation because dadada...You dont have to give an explanation. Like, make it as succinct and short as possible so youre not taking away class time from, like, what you need to do.  Okay! How do you feel? So thats intentional! Because a student is still engaging in this . Right? Yes.","[0.604000330114129, -0.06524464897980672, -0.17794495802473526, -0.0010241634615856354, 0.18831175998349584, 0.32631464347434636, 0.02598432510611117, -0.0177492958662439, -0.10941909346879997, -0.06390124035165058, -0.08108398604396494, 0.3099573260245714, -0.30407831708394845, -0.21151542554363592, -0.1912219900646684, -0.1562385714368488, -0.14287028341909627, 0.0965835002407598, 0.18520580831646194, 0.11957066090739439, 0.03797356878135358, 0.2256670520900552, 0.02718531304772215, -0.04385523894530029, -0.022131945915179575, -0.06583700395063549, 0.012086801340114993, 0.02479040939241792, -0.022184275868670483]",0.2643317150237819
transcript,0,10-2C,Behavior Study 1,behavior,2,,"Okay, so I think that wins. Don't like the simulation? Why is that? Okay, anxious. How about this particular experience? How-how'd you feel about that? Yeah, it does. But one thing I did see you do well is that despite all of those potential issues, you maintain your cool. So, like, an immediate response typically is to get frustrated, and then you might raise your voice and then you might start to get a little unreasonable or irrational, yeah, it wasn't like, ""Turn to the corner."" Something like that as opposed to a different type of addressing behavior point that would- not be as- as like that. So that's one thing you did really well. And so why is it important for you to maintain your calm? Yeah, so in a couple examples I saw at the very beginning, so when Ethan was making some video game noises or when Ethan started to whistle- you just continued to go on to try to set the expectations. But then when you asked a question to the other members of the class about suggestions, did they respond? They didn't. No, so what could have been a potential option there? Sure, but I'm talking about the video game noise specifically, so what could have been a response to that? Yeah. alright, so what would that look like? Yeah, well, so- so I want to challenge you to push back on that. So to be more specific and to be more succinct. So if Ethan's making some video game noises, how would you respond in a way that's specific and succinct that redirects his behavior back to what you'd like him to do? Okay, so let's go to that ""we"", is that specific? No, because it could, you know, Jasmine might be like, ""I wasn't doing anything, you know, what do you mean 'we'."" You realize that state. You think that's more specific that 'we'? Yes, absolutely, alright. Yeah, I mean, the goal, like, usually when you-when you do a name piece as well, you're establishing that my attention is now to you, is typically why would you want to do a red- or why- why are they misbehaving. Yeah, or they're used to trying to gain attention and so, you know, by doing a quick name, for example, you might give them that sliver of attention, but then you're immediately going to name the behavior and you're going to redirect the behavior- by giving them an action step. Okay, so what would a nonresponse look like if Ethan continued to say drum? What would a nonresponse from your end look like? You would ignore it? And what potentially could happen if you ignored it? Yeah, and so why is it important to address the behavior as soon as you see it? You get it to stop and what's even more important, not only does he stop, what does that permit you to do? I could do that, but what's it- I mean what's just a broader benefit to you to addressing the behavior immediately when it happens? What are you trying to do? Uh, fair, but you've done that. But then by doing that, what does that enable you to do? So if- if you identify the behavior with Ethan- ""Ethan, stop drumming, eyes on me"", what does that enable you to do after you say that? You can go back to teaching. Yeah, yeah, something just real, so by attending to those behaviors very specifically and quickly, that permits the classroom to continue that flow, and lets you continue teaching. Okay? So, let's do- let's do a practice. alright, so I'll be an off task- I'll be an off task student, and so I want you to practice- being specific and naming the behavior and giving an action step. Okay? So if I'm Jasmine. Great, so now what if you don't know it's my phone? So what if I'm just doing this? Great, great. So you skip the identification because you're not necessarily sure what it is and you just- But you gave her a specific action step on what you'd like her to do, right. So let's say, we'll just do one more before you have to jump back in. So, how else could you be specific with if I am, you know, doing some drumming? Okay, even more specific, or even more succinct, excuse me. And then action step. Eyes on me. Great. Let me say this, you try it. Okay, let's see them again.","[0.5194993709632443, 0.023576768930381554, 0.4160096487250111, 0.11532099984379114, -0.06840037006870718, -0.09380373352786672, -0.2900693673514618, -0.2984625201065864, -0.11295162091372471, -0.0069723705198002925, 0.10616962158723242, 0.07123751958028389, -0.08164662887584706, -0.3045925645756863, 0.35259656291371927, -0.14878409099696882, -0.0007858774072634199, -0.05149529384557192, -0.034104493731845854, -0.0953413191489693, 0.11163441684177422, 0.007840710441807234, -0.11494076606183667, 0.07820705367565518, -0.1399667868370054, 0.11289463628560525, -0.026754093308217028, 0.0597202703691689, 0.008444669057040109]",0.2188967631854828
transcript,15,2019_74_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,2,person4,"alright. So firstly, how do you think it went?  Okay. So what do you mean by horrible first of all. Lets just, were practicing. So, when you talk about horrible, what do you mean? Yeah. So, little frustration from what youre sharing! One of the things that I saw that I really liked is that on occasion, you did get him to what? You did get him to listen and pay attention. Yeah. So, there were some successes and so the goal of this conversation is for us to talk about potential strategies that you can use to be more more often. Okay. So but again, one thing I was excited about is that there were glimpses of that. And so, lets build off of that. So, one of the things that I saw is that you recognized when Ethan was being disruptive or when Dev was being disruptive. So, thats the first step is to be timely with your responses because what are you trying to do? Right. But even more general. You are trying to... Yeah, youre trying to teach, you know. So, you are trying to move through the lesson. And, youve got disruptions and issues along the way. And so, your goal is to try to find a way to be quick with them so you can keep the flow going with your own . So, one of the things that I liked, as I mentioned, is that you are very timely with a couple of them, with recognizing them. So now, what I like to focus most of our conversation was being specific. alright! With your redirections, alright! So, how can you be specific in a redirection if I do this? Lets say, my name is Dev. And, if Im doing this,  how can you use, to be specific in redirecting me? Well, begin. So, Im Dev. alright. Also, you might be like, Dev can you stop beating on the table. How can you be more specific? How can you be?  Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. So you even then, so now were the response even further to make it more succinct. alright. So thats like what we want to go down the road. Keep that really tight, but rather than saying can you do that, can you do that presents an for them to not do that. So, an example of that or the redirection would be, Dev  so lets hear again.  Okay. And then, what can you do to confirm?  That he doesnt start doing that right down there. So, you told to stop. But what could really prevented from even more in the future? Where are his hands to be? Yeah, very good. Great. All right. So, lets try it again. alright! Because we have those two segments, you had a name, stop the behavior and then you are going to offer the redirection on what youd like Dev to do. alright! More specific. Perfect. So instead of lets, because thats , because that sort of disperses the burden around the class and you are concerned about Dev. So I know there are some cases where youre like, I would want to be, you know, I dont want to name a student or call them out but you have to read, you have to name a student in the first place if you want him or her to know that youre actually talking to them. So, Dev, stop beating or drumming on the table, hands in your lap please. So its, stop this, Id like you to do that and there we go. Because its one thing to stop the behavior. Its another thing to actually tell the student what you want him or her to do. Okay! So, how about what would a nonspecific answer or look like if I was doing ? Whats a answers or redirection? Mm hmm. Excellent. Okay. Not specific at all because he could be focusing but he just does it to drum. So, you want to name the . So, name the student first name, name the behavior and name the . Okay! So, lets try a different one. alright. So, lets say that I am still lets say I am Ethan and start doing this. And, I want you to give me a specific redirection. Savannah Great. Okay. So, weve gotso were halfway there. Perfect. So, the first thing you did was asked me to do what?  Perfect. Youre good, so, you asked me to stop talking. But then what position am I still like? So then, whats the next thing you need to do?  Uh-huh. Even quicker you could just be, Ethan eyes on me. Yeah. So, it could be something real quick Ethan voices off, eyes on me. So, its real quick, because you are going to have five or six that are going to keep going. And so, the sooner you can go around and put out the fire to that. Okay! So, were going to focus on being specific with the naming of the behavior and then you are going to be specific in your . Make sense? Okay? That make sense? So, what did you say? You can just say, Ethan voices off. Because thats for a sound. Because he might be humming and then youre just like, Ethan voices off please. Because then that  Okay. Im excited. Now again, really specific.","[0.6340172014976612, 0.03390615985090158, 0.15137880736509685, 0.4119604038350851, -0.08337812847477982, 0.07484082979582299, -0.029023389851852065, 0.03224971840528244, 0.11869159586839892, 0.039727597236850785, -0.20879738364740294, 0.167897271784113, -0.1150915055499716, 0.2029370079031873, -0.02779876245223886, 0.06492672661648133, 0.021437020676633597, 0.1860628440274488, 0.03510714118246211, 0.13344946234631969, -0.09851470270941448, -0.24677098222981494, -0.06797789133178109, 0.2718397624769078, -0.008104917354059812, 0.040171227518276245, -0.141556954251075, 0.1252116265692906, 0.04801847198280312]",0.3368138178999184
transcript,10,2019_61_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,person3,"Go ahead and tell me your thoughts about what went well in the simulator and what you feel good. Okay. I mean all really good things to think about and like the right questions to ask so we can use this time checklist. Before we do that though, what I want to first tell you about today Im going to keep with the first thing I want to say is to tell you what you did well, which is that youve made sure to respond to every behavior. You didnt just like, ignore them or kind of talk over them which was great. So I want you to keep doing that and now well spend the rest of the time talking about that kind of tone of voice and wording and when to respond.  So for that last part, you should respond right away. The more that you let the behavior go on, the more that sends the message that hed think its acceptable sort of like and you dont want to send that message, especially when its a behavior thats like could be of other students learning. So as soon as you notice it, thats when you want to say some good norm in terms of what you say and how do you make to stay calm. So the fewer words that you use, you send more of a message of like this, like if you used to if you talk a lot about it, then youre sending a message of like, this is a big deal and Im taking a lots of energy and that makes it feel more dramatic. So, you want to add that gives you more chance to, like, be emotional. So, do you want to make it not like quick like talking fast but like few words and that will help you with some of that like just say it simply and move on. Oftentimes if you smile when youre saying if I can help with the positive tone. So lets do Ethans on his phone, right? alright. So Im Ethan on my phone, try to tell me what I should do. Perfect. Yeah. So that was nice and short, you didnt ask questions or be like because all of these, you know, yeah perfect. Do you want to try it again and add a little more positive tone for me.  Yeah, perfect. That is often like a nice way to begin.  So you can smile at the end also and saying thank you is reasonable. And then, you want to make sure that you quickly moved back to what youre saying. So it doesnt feel like you took the whole classes attention to, like, lets look at Ethan and what hes doing, should let can we do that and now were moving on. So now what Im going to ask you to do is, I want you to talk as if youre leading the discussion and Im going to misbehave while youre doing that. So like, you have to manage that kind of noticing me and responding to my and then going back to what you are trying to do. Okay. Im not going to do the phone one. Ill do a different one.  Try it again but focus on the not singing part rather than the because it lets get back to this discussion, I can be like well Im contributing to the discussion cause Im singing.  Then? One more time with a slightly more positive tone.  I know its hard. But like the positive tone was one of the things that I had to spend the most time like thinking about all the time when I was because its easy to get frustrated when you lost control   Perfect. And then keep on Excellent. Okay. We have about a minute left, so we can either do more practice or if you have questions so far of the things that you want to discuss. Yeah. So the answer is, its possible there might be certain kids that thats true for. In my experience, especially like on the first day of class or like yeah, towards the beginning before you norms, the positive is typically good for everybody. Because youre still clear, right, youre not saying like, dont sing. But you should as long as youre not being confusing, youre being clear about what you want, then students understand and you can always, if the behavior keeps going thats when you might need to change your tune. Does that make sense? Good question, though. All right, you got this.

transcript,16,2019_81_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,person7,"So, how are you feeling about that first simulation. Oh my gosh. Perfect so, okay. Yeah, I know, I think there was a lot that you did really well. So, like for example, you said things like, Ethan, please put away the technology. And did you notice that he put it away, right away. And you were like, Ethan, please remember to have a quiet voice. So, you were like, really direct with him and you were super calm. And then like when you were able to redirect then you would like facilitate the discussion. Thats awesome. I feel like there were a lot of really great things. The only thing I would say is just being like a tiny-like tweaking your language a little bit. Like when you say like, quiet down, I dont know if you noticed this but he said like, oh, then Ill like whistle more quietly or something like that. So, instead of quiet I would say like, our voices are off or you could even just use a non-verbal if you want. Yeah. Because I think like all of your redirections were really short, they were like very direct and then I would just like anytime, theres language thats ambiguous, he could interpret it, however he wants. So, just being really like whatever you want him to do or to stop doing, making sure that theres no that its like crystal clear. But yeah, I feel like that was great. For sure. So, Im going to be a misbehaving student and Im going to let you practice on me with that specific thing in mind before you go back in the simulation. You ready?  Awesome, that was perfect. So, like when you said turn your voice off, I was still going to keep going, but I love how you were like yeah, and put your hands on your lap. So, youre like, youve thought about like what my mouth was doing, what my hands were doing. If theyre like turning away from you, you could even be like eyes on me. So, just making it clear about each behavior. But, yeah, I think that was awesome. Why is that better than saying something more generic with them? Like lets be respectful or lets pay attention. Yeah. Because its like the first day, right. So, like respect, might look different to different people or paying attention in last years class might have, you know, it might have been okay to be moving around or making noise or whatever. Do you have anything else you want to troubleshoot? No, no, thats a good point. Yeah, maybe like pull out the most important piece or you ask them like which one do you think of those -that list you gave me, is the most important one. Im trying to remember when they were off-task- I mean, when they were giving off tasks suggestions, uhm like when Dave is talking about Rocket Club, oh you, were like we can discuss that after class. I would say something even more specific than that, because I feel like in that case, he was like, well like did you notice that he was like, oh well why after class, or I forget what he said but that would be like, Dev our voices are off unless were on topic. Something super explicit with that too. But is that what youre talking about like when theyre giving lots of suggestions for the norm? I dont know, I would just say like or you could like pose it to the other kids like okay, Savannah gave us two, should we pick one, should we pick both? Something like that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thats a good question. If theres any misbehavior happening, I would just address that first. And then, if they are still not really responding, I would just call on them directly. Uhm in this case, because theyre not like, real students, like I wouldnt worry about  time. Yeah. Because like I think like, if theyre not participating, it could be because the misbehave is distracting them. You know what I mean? So, dont wait for it but stop it. And then, start the conversation again. And if you need to like transition quickly like youre like voices are off, hands are together and then you could be like Savannah, whats a norm, you know, so that you can just immediately jump back in. Yeah, I think thats a good point. Yeah. Have fun.","[0.628909629065172, -0.15462315762629905, -0.07936783647491935, 0.051893919809650635, 0.10359108665380395, -0.2642194886194722, 0.0639652579084799, -0.31262421948051533, -0.2840846979991101, 0.13501621943204106, -0.02798567439198192, -0.0840319326916694, -0.07576788525875841, 0.15949021670435326, -0.21738950847440947, -0.17873672661902504, -0.013604814828807078, 0.07489369498183768, -0.048059833916150964, -0.04269308214012792, 0.28192818954011484, -0.18693362335235036, -0.05597744936109668, 0.029557760525433137, 0.07623278123239201, -0.11375231417210924, 0.038570153351782516, -0.15302387729099592, -0.005121320325924981]",0.25790529070422724
transcript,17,2019_97_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,person3,"I can tell that youre a little bit frustrated about... Yeah. You know, I understand, and thats just a limitation of the simulator But I will say, so I was a teacher for five years before coming here, and there are times where you are, like, across the room and its not logistically feasible to like get closer to the kid or to ask them to leave. So, like, the type of things that you can do here, even though its not the only things that you would do, the things that we are trying to get you to practice are still things that you will use sometimes and that will be helpful. Sure. I know, Im not advocating that you would yell, like its not about raising your voice. But like when you talk to students, youre often like, theres just a room of students, and you cant always go across immediately to them, especially if youre in the middle of direct instruction. It just gives more attention and more time. If you interrupt yourself, walk over to them, correct them, and come back. So, its actually much more efficient and it sort of moves on and makes them less embarrassed if youre able to give them a short and quick of what the behavior should be. And then, they can just kind of move on and say things. So, especially if youre worried about like what youre saying, one of the easiest and best things to do is nonverbal . So, going like right Yeah. Yes. Right. But, when you start, when youre on your first day as a teacher, you will have to manage the classroom, and you dont know whether or not likeand I know it feels like hes doing so much stuff and its like a lot, but I definitely had days where kids, especially if you dont address the first behavior, where kids will continue to do more and more things. And, it can easily get frustrating. And, the more tools you have and the more comfort you have with, like, what you can try, you know, definitely uses those other tools that youre learning but the more that you have a wider toolbox, the more likely you are to be able to address it for whatever that kid needs and sort of move on successfully. Does that make sense? So, a lot, so the thing that I wanted to focus on for the coaching is a lot of your conversations ended up being like a back and forth between you and the student or you say, hey, Ethan Im waiting for, to get their attention. And, what I want to encourage you to do to not use so much instructional time and to make it quick is just to say, hey, Ethan I need you to be silent right now. And thats it. Move on. Dont keep talking and engaging with him. Then, you have a whole other conversation, but this practice isnt aboutbut at the moment So, its possible that you can just repeat that. Like, I would give twice at least. Like, please be quiet or please be silent. And then, if doesnt then you can talk about but I dont think there were any times that I sawthere were a few times where you were like please be respectful or you sort of made general comments. But you can specifically say please do this, that might be where it felt like you said something. You can also tell them not like, like what not to do. So, you can say Exactly. Yeah, if thats more comfortable for you, then use that. And then, just leave it at that, give the student a little bit of time to show that they heard and corrected before you keep talking. Otherwise, they are just going to tune out. It just takes more time and you get worked up. The more you talk about it, the more frustrated, not you ... Well, this is just meant to give you that...  alright, so Im going to pretend to be...  So, start talking so that I can interrupt you and get that practice. The other students? What do you mean?  Oh, they will but not if someone else is talking because they cant hear. Its like if someone else is misbehaving, they get distracted by the misbehavior so thats another reason that you should be making sure Okay. alright. So, leading class norms.   No question, just stop because you dont want to give him the option to say no I wont do that. Yes. Just nice and simple and move on and that way you can move past that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that was the end of the five minutes. I mean, you can go up there and take a minute and like think about what we talked about. I justwe cant continue to have like...","[0.5622812189826345, -0.2423885536669524, -0.2896206652153538, -0.03194108412823437, -0.3109520874915058, 0.18774372551717602, 0.05474766820262296, -0.055543539286654, -0.04060157481366983, -0.18664254460991841, 0.021977871179349594, -0.09059636806502731, 0.06490709283832831, 0.056248073430055, 0.11475206134363744, -0.020352564527906476, 0.4332812203430027, -0.1185290923858404, 0.30675525722628894, 0.09276088556102288, 0.10005721307897725, 0.04250050968297367, -0.02122814545642956, 0.07167492162042575, -0.046564889282864716, -0.08724483117905814, -0.02233696650704506, -0.056773897263904465, 0.025284363718109517]",0.22229518213505625
transcript,7,89-2C,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,,"alright. So, first of all, how you think that went? And what's that mean? Yeah? how do you feeling? Yeah, just alright? Yeah? One thing I saw that I really liked is that despite opposition and redirection opportunities, you've maintained your cool. So, why is it absolutely essential to maintain your cool? What does that mean, things will escalate? Yeah, which is a likely thing to happen, particularly for a middle school classroom, you know they sort of feed off of that. But one thing that, again, that you did really well and is that maintained a very calm demeanor throughout and so I wanna encourage you to do that for this next simulation because that, as you just mentioned, can be really bad if they start to feed off of sort of your frustration, um, including, you know, sort of facial reactions in your affect in addition to the directions as well. mhmm. Yeah, they do. Yeah. So, that was a good piece. One of the things I wanna focus this conversation on is giving specific and succinct redirections to students. So on the whole, it took a little bit of time, but eventually, you were pretty specific, especially that last one. The last one was awesome.  mentioned to , oh, excuse me, to Ethan. He started talking in his impersonations that your comment was eyed up here and listen silently, please. I mean, that was great. Specific, succinct and just move right through it. alright? And so a little bit more like that for these future redirections. I think it's going to be awesome. alright, so let's take an example. Let's say Ava is turning to look at Jasmine. What's a specific and a succinct redirection you could use if I'm talking over here to Jasmine right now? See, that's specific enough. You're speaking. Yeah, so Ava's talking over here to Jasmine. What could you say to Ava? Okay. So one thing I wanna encourage you to do is why would a student misbehave? What's a typical reason that a student sort of acts out in class? Yeah, and what's-what's another more common reason that's just sort of more base level, they simply want what? Yeah I just want like some attention. Particularly with sort of middle schoolers. One thing I wanna encourage you to do is to name the student before you give them the redirection because if you use sort of a general thing of like, we should have our listening ears on. Is that specific to the potential offender? No. alright, so over here, just wanna add Ava's name before that. You know Ava, voices off and turn and face me, please. You know, so you've named them but you've given her action step of voices off and then turn and face me but you've also given her that little hint of you know, ""Oh my gosh like I was noticed. You know, out of all 20 people. She said my name. alright. So that's one example for Ava. Let's say that Savannah is looking down and you think she has her phone but you're not sure. So what could be a specific and a succinct redirection for Savannah? Okay, so she might have her hands, you know, on her phone, so what's the potential redirection for the hands as well as her eyes? Yes, well, there's a tech issue there too, but you just say, you know, ""Hands on your lap please,"" you know, just something like that. If you suspect that there's some kind of issue, you know. So, what would that text look like then? What would you say? If you thought I had my phone out and I was Savannah? Okay. So then- So then what would you say? Is that specific? How could you be getting even more specific than eyes up here or as up here? Yeah there we go . Yeah, so, just really simple. ""Savannah, eyes up here on me."" Okay. What would a nonresponsive look like from your angle if you chose not to address Savannah's behavior, what a non-response look like from your end? Yeah, well, from your end you would just not say a word and you went and attached it and then what's the likely consequence of that? Sounds good? So, name the student, and there's in that specific and a succinct redirection. Okay? I might jump in on the hear bug but I might not. alright, I'm excited to see you try. Let's do it.","[0.5562795731182689, -0.05180811454241078, 0.42603815861983896, 0.1843529716769996, -0.1580970085344405, -0.10012075143954635, -0.042530857986639796, 0.14668426081003538, -0.23506400384501608, -0.2677899848310952, -0.015239411196787863, -0.17780712868418536, 0.009059683359971784, -0.14018660159234184, -0.22102003879019677, 0.13192157244061184, 0.0751787331357594, 0.05185560835948515, -0.14973440659562617, -0.05766992499726249, 0.07554206716855857, 0.15393276823384391, 0.17185634971963565, -0.020765660944856684, 0.11392943290876992, -0.0597914236284874, -0.22963219051861095, 0.0800277668302034, -0.009146553386479527]",0.23140253372766773
transcript,4,84-2C,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,,"So how do you feel about that first run? What was rough? Yeah, I mean I think you did like a nice job, like you-- Don't-don't beat yourself up about it. So there's like really nice things that you did in that and so, for example, um, you know, like-- Sorry I'm just like looking through my notes. So, um, there are a lot of times that you provided these like really specific redirections to students like, they were plainly misbehaving, um, so eventually you would say like, ""Ethan, can you please stop talking. Can you please stop talking and be respectful."" And that   a good really turns. You do a really nice job providing the specific, um, redirections to students. So what I think we're gonna move to the next one, um, that would hopefully be helpful is to provide really succinct redirections to students. Um, so sometimes it would take you a while to get to that specific redirection, so for example on this one-- Um, Ethan is talking about the, um, ""Are you trying to be Darth Vader?"" and so he's talking about the Jedi code, and so you guys kinda enter into this back and forth and say that we don't necessarily live by the Jedi code but we can either work in the community that's quite   less like the other people's responses, things like that. Um, and then you get to do the, ""Ethan can you please be-could you please stop talking and be respectful."" And so that like succinct to the end and like if you've forefronted it-- Does that make sense? Like make the-the statement at a specific moment and going in-in that beginning. Um, so for example, um, let's say that, you know, a student is drumming on the desk. You wanna be as specific and as succinct as possible, so just say, ""I need you to stop drumming right now."" And then you can get- you can hopefully get right back into your-your conversations, but it's specifically meaning- what's happening? Drumming on the desk, there's that, and I'm being succinct about that. Why do you think that's a-a good way to like go with your redirections? Yes, so why would you not wanna engage in that? Like-- Yeah, yeah. I think that's such a good reason to do it, because then you're wasting so much time talking about that versus getting to the content at hand or the task at hand. Um, so what would a non-example of a succinct redirection would be? Yeah. Well, explain it to me, like, why is it a non-example and how we're finding  ? Yeah, or is it- you know if, um, someone starts talking about their volleyball match or something like that, and you are engaging with them like, ""Well what is it about your volleyball team? What do you guys do?"" And you're taking a long time to get there, like you really wanted to be succinct or even if you start explaining like the whys, like you just get to the-to the redirection. Okay? Um, so let's practice. I will be a, um, misbehaving student and you can redirect my behavior. My name's , if you forget it. That's good. So I like that you went like to stop talking because if-if you just say focus here, what is that, what is that, you know? So- and especially great thinking in our simulation on the first day so if you go to the-the specific behavior that you wanna have-have happened and that was to stop talking, or no side conversations, um, or listen silently, voices off. There's plenty of things that you can say that are really specific. Okay? Do you have any questions for me? Okay, alright, so, um, you're gonna go back in. Um, it's gonna be five minutes, um, like the first session never happened. So you're back at the-the very beginning. Okay? Cool. Let's do it.

transcript,3,7-2C,Behavior Study 1,behavior,3,,"alright. So how do you think that went? What do you mean? What's not well? True. alright, how are you feeling though? Okay, why so? Okay. mhmm. Well, I think, first of all, frustrations, of course. You know, behavior management is a huge issue. Uh, but one thing I saw that you did really well that I like is that you did not lose your cool in the face of five minutes of behavioral regression. So why is it important to not lose your cool? Particularly in middle school classroom. Yeah, elementary and high a little different, but middle schoolers are particularly prone to eating as you mentioned, so if you don't respond to misbehavior, what's a likely response gonna happen from the students? Gets worse, yeah. So one student is gonna do it and then typically they'll   on one another, alright? So one thing that I wanna have us focus on for this next simulation is how to give specific and succinct redirections. alright, so for example, let's take a look at Ethan's drumming. What's a specific and succinct redirection you could give if Ethan starts drumming? Okay, so one thing I wanna- I wanna encourage you to do is name the behavior- by using their name as well and then name their action or redirection, okay? So why would it be important to use the name of the student? Okay, so also if you use the name of the student, so fair on that point. You're also being more specific as opposed to like we're-we're, ""We all have our listening ears on."" Is like- does that really- is that specific? No and-and it kinda creates a situation as you've mentioned where some of the students are like, ""I was listening."" So, also why would students act out in the classroom most often? No. Okay, also or they just simply want what? Yeah, they want attention and so by using their name briefly, what do you give them? Yeah, you give them that hit. So it could be, ""Ethan, stop drumming, hands down."" So you've- so you've named the action, you know, he's drumming and then you give him an action of hands down, alright? Or hands on your lap. You know, that kind of thing, okay? So let's see, what about- what about when Dev brings up something that's off topic? He does loves rockets, he loves superheroes, but how could you give a quick, specific and succinct redirection to keep Dev on task? Okay. Okay, so he's probably looking at you already- because he's sharing out this superhero, so one thing could be, ""Dev, that's not y'know, that's-that's not on task right now, voices off please."" You know, 'cause you're giving him the specific action of voice is off. You know, stop talking works but there's also sort of that effect piece- you know here as well- as opposed to like, ""Shut up"" you know? alright, so what would a non-response look like if you just let Dev continue to talk about things that were off task? Uh-huh, and what's likely to happen? Uh-huh, and so you've lost two of them. Savannah's three and then potentially  as well alright. So, let's practice. So let's say my name is  and you're our- you're the teacher and you see me looking down like this. Now, you don't know that I have a phone but what's a redirection you could give? You weren't specific. Perfect. Yeah, alright, so you gotta- so that name gives them that hit, and then eyes on me, please. Now what if they still continue- Okay, so that's one of the tech. Well, you can get your hands on lap. Yeah, so got, "", hand on your lap, please. You know, eyes on me."" And then you just keep on going. alright? So what about let's say Jasmine starts to whisper to Eva. So how would you- how would you engage that? Okay, was Eva talking? alright, so it was just a Jasmine thing. So Jasmine voices off, eyes on me please, okay? So just real simple. So you're naming the student, you're naming the behavior. So Ethan you know stop drumming or Dev that's an off-task contribution, you know, voices off, please. You can also do a non-verbal, you know. If you want to as well. alright, and so all of that though is encompassing, again that very nice affect as you had the first time because again if you lose your cool, what's likely to happen? Yeah, and then? Yeah. Yeah, the class exploded. alright, so it's important though for that non-response 'cause if you don't respond, it prohibits you from really doing what ultimately? Yeah, so- alright, let's   this to practice. Specific, succinct. Name the student, name the behavior, name the redirection, okay?","[0.5985432945334412, 0.026909996996568868, 0.5084463308711691, 0.07700149556748438, -0.15705197329301743, -0.02546681203605124, 0.0315821971247383, 0.04020286217491445, -0.09026035092428503, -0.2984786041456967, 0.016659898512086685, 0.0891214769136796, -0.10670426040032752, 0.05397919801943749, 0.012519089369985642, 0.13195556995467048, -0.014348215210766263, 0.05133687556261623, -0.04225224247693365, 0.07663668878358042, -0.2063144137067932, -0.028209446719171492, -0.0657895432712735, -0.05876961008400121, -0.006940809113906405, 0.000724882242334637, 0.2881936376552021, -0.2577174193083111, 0.01250100504388037]",0.26870264668672444
transcript,24,2019_75_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,3,person4,"alright. So, how do you feel about it?  So what does that mean, explain the rationale?  Sure. So, the types of norms? Yeah. So, one of that was like, so I saw you moving through that conversation, which was great. But a couple of that that conversation was tripped up by some of those behaviors.  So, how you think you did with redirecting from Ethan and Dev. How do you feel about it? Sure. Right. Very correct. Yeah. So, one of the things that I saw is that on several occasions you were very timely or you just hit it real quick. So, as soon as you heard it, or as soon as you saw it, you identified the . So, then the next piece too on occasion you were with the redirection. There are sometimes where you get a little bit more vague. And then, there were even a couple more times where you really tight with the whole redirection. So, an example of a really tight redirection that you have thats specific and quick is, for example, Ethan phone away eyes on me. Very quick, its very specific because its step one phone away, step two eyes on me, and your succinct as opposed to, what would be a non-succinct response to that? If I am Ethan and if Im on my phone, whats a non-succinct response that you can recall? Right. Or something like, you know, were not to be doing things right now that are distracting. And, is that with what hes doing? No. So, good. alright. So, then why dont we with an example of you being succinct, and then specific and timely. So, were going to keep going on specific and timely. And, I want to really focus on this very tight redirection. how would you direct that? More succinct Stop what? On the There we go. alright. So, just be very specific because when I stopped tapping this is general. So, because what are you trying to do for the rest of the time? Yeah. So, youre trying to move through our lesson. And so, the quicker that you can identify a behavior, name the student, tell them specifically what you want them to do and do it quickly the sooner you can do what? The sooner you can continue with the lesson. So in many ways, like over and over your training, what we are preparing for is that this just becomes second nature where you might have seven or eight , for example, in one minute. And, you are still able to proceed through it, because you are redirecting while you are continuing to move through the lesson. So, why is it beneficial or why is it beneficial for a succinct response based on what weve talked about so far? What do you think? Right. Okay. So, lets try one more time. So lets see, how would you respond if I started doing this.  How could you be more succinct? What would you like me to do though? So is that , were not having conversations? So how could you, what do you truly want me to do? And? Eyes on me. Because Im looking over here. Im talking to Savannah, for example. So, you need to be called me by name. And then, the first thing is voices off, eyes on me. Or stop talking please. Eyes on me. So, Im with you on the call out piece about naming that, but they have to know that youre speaking to them as opposed to the general we. Does that make sense about trying to avoid the word we? So you want to again, be very specific and then try to be very succinct. Okay? alright, So, really excited, to see you be succinct. Weve got great examples of the timely and the and so were going to push you to be more specific, timely but then also very tight about those redirections. Sounds good? alright.","[0.5522985299533579, 0.06468612744392137, 0.15141664810170657, 0.4275248929874935, 0.05626292882469261, 0.1906715375688964, -0.026202977928368405, 0.0728207063330728, 0.22825598710516226, 0.35527339500966576, -0.010095006589194622, 0.08962446071077838, 0.1781603500721266, -0.1538418750822269, -0.11051601706105241, -0.09287617125592494, 0.27556789463792564, -0.0650022054230961, -0.18762867382610063, -0.028504359892224447, -0.009748276198224767, 0.09960659146678039, -0.10541534544149213, -0.055931789242895824, 0.12245225902259106, -0.06453418258677028, 0.08424369155026845, -0.06642041985287818, -0.07588899930713845]",0.3231548087311509
transcript,5,93-2C,Behavior Study 1,behavior,4,,"Come on I said   Um, so how are you feeling? How was the first one? Yeah, you lose by  of it that is per the day. Yeah, and I think you are doing a really nice job like you you've really timed it like even like a couple times I wanted to like redirect and like you were already starting your re-directions like you are like, right on it. I mean you did a lot of really nice like specific like succinct to your actions. I mean you started drumming, um, you know can you put your hands on your laps please like you were right in there. There are, um, a couple of times and this is like just making things even more specific and succinct because you did like such a good job it's like you should be accomplished with that. So we are just working on tools like make it even better. Um, when you are saying, ""Can you please come back"" try to think about ways to make that more specific. So you said that I can tell like that's definitely one of the things that you say. Um, but make sure that you are, you are like naming specifically what you wanna have happen so that if there are, they are like off task they are, they are drumming and they are humming and they are talking about classically and like you are naming what you wanna have happen as if you are just doing like a, a very generic, ""Can you please come back."" It's not, you like you need to name   Does that make sense? Um, but- but you did a really nice job and a lot of times you pair those things together and say it like, ""Can you please come back"" pretty make with your laps or something. Um, so sometimes you needed just skip straight at it to the change you are asking. Um, so, um, one thing I also wanna talk about is this is not like a you use this type of things, this is just like where I think you are. Like words are talking about like really you want such a type things? Um, and that's like the tone of your voice that you are using and again I don't want this to come across as like, ""You sounded harsh."" But what, you did such a good job. We can talk about how your tone and things like that can influence what the students take away from it too. Um, so one thing that can happen when, um, teachers are providing here are specifics succinct re-directions that can come across like really harsh. So there's a very big difference between, you know, ""Savanna I need you to put your pencils down right now."" Versus, ""Savanna put your pencils down right now."" And so there's one thing that I want you to be thinking as to like how tone influences what happens. Does that make sense? Um, so what do you think that tone like why is tone important? take or give out. Yeah. So in what ways tell it. Like keep talking, keep talking. Yeah, yeah. I think you are right on with that. That it's and it's just as creating like this   especially when you think that like this is the first day of school, it's creating this atmosphere like there are this clear expectations and I'm gonna be very specific about them but also know that I care about you. You know, like you   so much through. Like you're telling me. Um, I feel like it's really important to know that like all is just keep ahead in the back of your head. Um, so what we can do know is that I will be an off task student and and you can provide a redirection speed that will be a specific and succinct like you did in the first simulation and we can work on each of the specifics like that okay? My name is Yeah, that's great. So, and I can even tell like you know, you weren't harsh in the first one at all but I can tell you changed your tone like you were thinking about it during that. Um, so in event you're saying, you know, like, "", please stop drumming."" You know, it's all in that. It's very specific, it's succinct, it's naming this behavior and it's really calm. Do you have any questions for me? Okay. Good, I'm glad. Um, if-so you are gonna go back in for five minutes and it's like the first one never happened so you are back at the beginning. Um, so that you reuse the expectations. Any questions or any first thing? Okay. Cool.

transcript,6,72-2C,Behavior Study 1,behavior,4,,"So how do you feel about that? Yeah? Ethan's a lot? Yeah, I think you did a nice job like handling him though and you know, even Dev went off in the um, superhero-- Yes, so that's something we can talk about in these five minutes, for sure. Like I think if you can do that like that's why we also don't know we waste a lot of time- like in-indulging in that. Like it could relate, but it-- Okay. Well we got through the simulation so that- Oh, okay. Um, yeah so if you-- What was I saying. So yeah, so I- but I- you wanted to make sure like you're spending the most amount of time on the norm. So if you constantly find yourself being like, ""But how does that relate?"" you should be like, ""We're not talking about that right now."" We're talking about the rules. And so I think- and doing it with a calm manner um, I think will really help. So I that's what like- you did a really nice job like addressing all them like even when I wasn't the bug in your ear, like you address things like right away. And even in the last one, I know that like Ethan kept going and so- but you had said like, ""Quiet voices,"" you had like addressed it immediately and I thought it was great. You did very specific feedbacks, like you just knew exactly what you want. So when he did like- Ethan was drumming and you said, ""Quiet hands please,"" like that's very clear with like what you want. Um, and then it was very succinct, like it was so- it was right on there, so one thing-uh, no. We're gonna kinda talk to make your next simulation like even stronger 'cause I want like- you should feel really good about what you did. It's like tell about using like kind of a-a calm tone and like a-how your affect can play a part in it too, you know what I'm- you know what I'm saying? Uh, so let's think about, um, if Ethan or Dev or , whoever is off topic, so let's say that they're humming or singing. Um, how could you respond in a way that is still specific and succinct like you did in this-this last simulation? Give me one that has like a calmer affect or tone. Yeah sure, phrasing or what like in your-your tenor of your pitch, things like that. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's huge, I think you're right on with that--I didn't mean to interrupt. Yeah that's great, so what would a non-response be, or like something that we wouldn't consider, um, like a calm-using a calm affect? Yeah, so give me an example. Yeah. I tell like it's almost hard for you  to like get in that. I think you're right adding like the, ""Please,"" in there, but I think a lot of it comes in through at the like the tenor-- You know what- you know what I mean- by saying like the tenor, like-- So I think- and you can also be assertive there too. Like there's- it's this really fine line of being like, ""Please be quiet,"" or saying ""Please be quiet."" You know, so you don't wanna like throw off the like quiet, tired, resignate- like resigned like, you know what I mean? Okay um, so why do you think it's good to like present that? Like calm manner, like what does that do for the classroom? mhmm. Yeah. Great so we can do a whole- just do it real quick. Oh, that's five minutes. Okay. Were you- do you have any questions for me or? Okay, alright we're gonna ask you to keep the- your the thingie in your ear and- sorry was the thing- the technology still flipping back? Well we have a breakdown. Um, right, so you're good on your questions? alright, so I'm- you're not gonna hear me, I will not speak, but we just ask you to keep it in- for consistency's sake.

transcript,11,2019_87_5C_Transcript,Behavior Study 2,behavior,4,person3,"What do you think you did well? Yeah. So, I noticed a lot of times you would give them I assume what you mean by giving the opportunity is sort of saying like, do you remember what we just talked about or were you listening? And then, you would if it kept going, you would say like please stop this. Right? So, I think its a good idea and sentiment that you want to sort of give them the opportunity to correct their behavior and not embarrass them... Interviewee  Im also thinking that its the first day of school so theres like, no rapport between me and them, and that, like, we just met each other. Sure yeah. So, I understand like why youre it that way. What I want to encourage you to do is to take the thing that youre doing really well, which is at the end, youre saying really clearly, this is what I want you to do, or this is what I dont want you to do. And, actually just use that from the beginning. And whether you want to sort of like build rapport and keep things positive, thats about the tone of voice that you use when you give them the direction, and then what you say afterwards. So, ideally what you want to do is if Im talking about, hey class, remember what I said about norms and you start banging on the table, I would say hey, hey , please stop banging the table right now. , do you have any for norms, and so my whole voice is positive, Im not like, youre so terrible or anything like that. And then, Im including them, Im making sure that Im bringing them back to participate in the , so they can see like no big deal, like you just did what you needed to and we moved on, kind of thing. And thats the best way in my as a teacher and that were sort of taught to teach you here to sort of say like, protect their feelings, but still make it really clear what it is that you want. Because a lot of times, students misbehave and have more problems when theres less clarity about what they want. And when you ask the questions and you give them a choice, you have the that you may end up with just a lot of confusion, and kids can take that and be, like, well I am listening or I dont want to. And, so it makes it more constant, does that makes sense? alright. If you would start talking, so that I you.  What was the first part you said? I would like you to please stop singing? Okay. So, I want you to cut out as many extra words as possible because the more words you have, the more chance for them to... Yeah. Or you can say my name. , pleaseyou can use please, please stop singing. And, I know you want to explain to them like, this is why Im telling you. But dontdont spend all the extra time explaining. Does that make sense? alright. So, dont worry about talking, Ill just say la, la, la, la. Perfect. Okay. Now, Ive told you why I thought that was better but you tell me, why do you think it would be more helpful to have just a sort of fewer-words response. So, I understand what youre saying. And I think that youre putting a lot of tone into the stop that doesnt need to be there. And I promise you I used stop talking all the time with students. And as long as you do it calmly and with a smile, positive and bring them back to the conversation. It isnt abrasive and it ends up being its easier for them to save face. Because its less embarrassing because then they dont feel like theyre being lectured at. And they have to respond to you and be like, Im going to win this argument. If youre just say it and move on, then they have the choice to behave or not behave. If they dont behave at that point, thats like a whole other, you know, call a parent or a  , like other type of thing. But that way youve given them the chance to just like quickly fix it and move on, and it doesnt have to become something bigger. Does that make sense?  And totally, definitely dont, you dont want to be like stop talking. For sure, for sure. Thats super important. Does that make you feel a little bit better about what Im asking? alright. You got this. And it will help the stop faster too so you dont need to get to that stage.","[0.5988738638989562, -0.28464286187245935, -0.4213488939006486, 0.11964021591177793, -0.2584579464720877, -0.0036082228838618213, -0.018091764848668326, 0.028397647949264877, 0.03745536134153682, -0.03828007635524861, 0.06579238725803996, -0.1794337456475915, -0.02381698798421118, -0.06447623551955581, -0.07124540989602825, 0.059658317627527956, -0.07366089452368846, 0.14967263751395968, -0.0015835507692138692, -0.004605871239828878, 0.09393300725211186, 0.016536185910948343, -0.10360356975639982, -0.045792578433837425, 0.16840661420145486, 0.3052037603188706, 0.21887029297295485, 0.1665173498735227, -0.029297533719167046]",0.1863330619207272
