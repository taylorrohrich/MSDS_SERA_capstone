TC used a specific bodily cue in one of her redirections.

Disruptions were lengthy and detracted from the overall quality of the discussion. 
The teacher candidate did not support student engagement. Therefore, there were few moments where all students were engaged in on-task behavior. Some students may be engaging in off-task behavior. Others may be compliant, but not actively engaged.

I think it is an effective enough idea for practicing instructional approaches for small group setting,  but the classroom management scenario feels much more forced.  It feels like there is one specific way to get Ethan to stop his behavior (give a timely and specific order), but of course you don't know this your first time around.  The coach then tells you exactly what to do, and the next go around, Ethan magically responds.  It seems the goal is not to manage but to find the management technique you need to ""beat"" the simulator.   If this is the management technique you want us to learn, why not just tell us that?  Why not just have the coach come to our class as a whole and give this instruction and modeling?  It also odd, that given the extreme and constant emphasis in Curry on classroom culture, norms, and preventative action, that we would suddenly be asked to do management devoid of all of this and instead manage after-the-fact.
