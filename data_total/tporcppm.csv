Redirections are lengthy and lack firmness to actually address misbehavior. Most misbehaviors required more than one redirection to stop the misbehavior. At times, the teacherâs tone is sharp and agitated. Although the teacher does facilitate students in developing 3 norms, only one has a justification. She acknowledges behaviors pretty quickly. She does get wrapped up in Devâs off-topic conversation about rocket club.

-The teaching candidate supported students in generating 2-3 reasonable classroom expectations. They may or may not have supported students in providing rationale for these. 

-The teacher candidate inconsistently supported student engagement. All students were on-task and demonstrating signs of engagement for some of the simulation.

-TC used specific redirections for almost all behaviors. 
-Overall teacher candidate affect is not calm and may grow less so over the course of the simulation. TC was visibly irritated and grew more so over the course of the simulation.

Nonverbal cue with Ethan and Dev

TC supports students in developing 3 norms, 2 with rationale. Her redirections are inconsistent. She attempts to use non-verbal cues with finger over the mouth, but follows it up with optional misbehavior cues like could you doâ¦ to which avatars respond no. Some of her redirections are quite lengthy. She briefly gets pulled into the texting and rocketry misbehavior, but eventually redirects students out of it. Avatars are somewhat disengaged, especially toward the end. TC becomes slightly agitated with Ethan on the phone redirection. TC sits squarely in the middle of the mid range profile.

-TC effectively redirected one misbehavior
-Redirections were really lengthy and detracted from the overall quality of the conversation
The majority of dialogue/sounds are (a) TC engaging with students about their behavior (b) TC attempts to keep the discussion afloat during unaddressed student misbehavior (c) student misbehavior.
-TC affect was really warm and positive but they got more rattled/nervous as the simulation continued
-The teacher candidate did not support student engagement. Therefore, there were few moments where all students were engaged in on-task behavior.

The TC helped students generate 4 norms with rationale, putting her in the high category. She also redirected most misbehaviors with specific bodily cues. However, several redirections were initially unsuccessful because she asked students if they could stop instead of being more direct with her redirection. Some redirections were succinct, while others were lengthier. She let Dev talk for a quite a while about rocket club, which pulled the score down slightly. Her tone was mostly positive, but became more curt with Ethan nearing the end of the simulation.

TC does not effectively redirect any misbehaviors, putting him in the middle of the low category. He gets sucked into conversation about several misbehaviors. He ignores the whispering misbehavior. TC waits a significant amount of time to address misbehaviors, allowing them to escalate and impact other students (low range). They develop 2 classroom norms pulling the score up to the midrange, but neither have a rationale. However, TCâs affect is generally casual and calm despite student misbehaviors (pulling the score up slightly).

-The teacher attempted, with mixed success, to redirect off task student behavior. TC successfully redirected two misbehaviors but most redirections were lengthy and detracted from the overall quality of the conversation
-Affect was really positive
-The majority of dialogue/sounds are (a) TC engaging with students about their behavior (b) TC attempts to keep the discussion afloat during unaddressed student misbehavior (c) student misbehavior.
-The teacher candidate did not support student engagement. Therefore, there were few moments where all students were engaged in on-task behavior. Some students may be engaging in off-task behavior. Others may be compliant, but not actively engaged..
