The TC helped students generate 4 norms with rationale, putting her in the high category. She also redirected most misbehaviors with specific bodily cues. However, several redirections were initially unsuccessful because she asked students if they could stop instead of being more direct with her redirection. Some redirections were succinct, while others were lengthier. She let Dev talk for a quite a while about rocket club, which pulled the score down slightly.

TC supports students in developing 3 norms, 2 with rationale. Her redirections are inconsistent. She attempts to use non-verbal cues with finger over the mouth, but follows it up with optional misbehavior cues like could you do… to which avatars respond no. Some of her redirections are quite lengthy. She briefly gets pulled into the texting and rocketry misbehavior, but eventually redirects students out of it. Avatars are somewhat disengaged, especially toward the end. TC becomes slightly agitated with Ethan on the phone redirection. TC sits squarely in the middle of the mid range profile.

TC does not effectively redirect any misbehaviors, putting him in the middle of the low category. He gets sucked into conversation about several misbehaviors. He ignores the whispering misbehavior. TC waits a significant amount of time to address misbehaviors, allowing them to escalate and impact other students (low range). They develop 2 classroom norms pulling the score up to the midrange, but neither have a rationale. However, TC’s affect is generally casual and calm despite student misbehaviors (pulling the score up slightly).

They develop 3 norms, but with no rationale, bringing the score to the low side of the middle range. TC is mostly positive, but redirections are not timely and often require a revision to actually be specific enough to stop behavior. Conversation is largely dominated by TC. She does not push students for rationale and redirections are very teacher-centered.

Redirections are lengthy and lack firmness to actually address misbehavior. Most misbehaviors required more than one redirection to stop the misbehavior. At times, the teacher’s tone is sharp and agitated. Although the teacher does facilitate students in developing 3 norms, only one has a justification. She acknowledges behaviors pretty quickly. She does get wrapped up in Dev’s off-topic conversation about rocket club.
